# How to run:

## Backend:
backend>pip install -r requirements.txt </br>
... </br>
backend>uvicorn main:app OR python -m uvicorn main:app </br>
</br>
## Frontend:
frontend>npm install </br>
frontend>npm run dev

System currently only works locally, deployment reconfiguration would be needed to replace all handler api links to the backend hosted environment.
