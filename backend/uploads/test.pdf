The early summer sky was the color of cat vomit.  Of course, Tally thought, youâ€ ™ d have to feed your cat only salmon - flavored cat food for a  while, to get the pinks right. The scudding clouds did look a bit fishy, rippled into scales  by a high - altitude wind. As the light faded, deep blue gaps of night peered through like an  upside - down ocean, bottomless and cold.  Any other summer, a sunset like this would have been beautiful. But nothing had been  beautiful since Peris turned pretty. Losing your best friend sucks, even if itâ€ ™ s only for three  months and two days.  Tally Youngblood was waiting for darkness.  She could see New Pretty Town through her open window. The party towers were  already lit up, and snakes of burning torches marked flickering pathways through the  pleasure gardens. A few hot - air balloons pulled at their tethers against the darkening pink  sky, their passengers shooting safety fireworks at other balloons and passing parasailers.  Laughter and music skipped across the water like rocks thrown with just the right spin,  their edges just as sharp against Tallyâ€ ™ s nerves.
Around the outskirts of the city, cut off from town by the black oval of the river,  everything was in darkness. Everyone ugly was in bed by now.  Tally took off her interface ring and said, â€œGood night.â€   â€œSweet dreams, Tally,â€    said the room.  She chewed up a toothbrush pill, punched her pillows, and shoved an old portable  heaterâ€”one that produced about as much warmth as a sleeping, Tally - size human beingâ€”  under the covers.  Then she crawled out the window.  Outside, with the night finally turning coal black above her head, Tally instantly felt better.  Maybe this was a stupid plan, but anything was better than another night awake in bed  feeling sorry for herself. On the familiar leafy path down to the waterâ€ ™ s edge, it was easy  to imagine Peris stealing silently behind her, stifling laughter, ready for a night of spying  on the new pretties. Together. She and Peris had figured out how to trick the house  minder back when they were twelve, when the three - month difference in their ages seemed
like it would never matter.  â€œBest friends for life,â€    Tally muttered, fingering the tiny scar on her right palm.  The water glistened through the trees, and she could hear the wavelets of a passing river  skimmerâ€ ™ s wake slapping at the shore. She ducked, hiding in the reeds. Summer was  always the best time for spying expeditions. The grass was high, it was never cold, and  you didnâ€ ™ t have to stay awake through school the next day.  Of course, Peris could sleep as late as he wanted now. Just one of the advantages of being  pretty.  The old bridge stretched massively across the water, its huge iron frame as black as the  sky. It had been built so long ago that it held up its own weight, without any support from  hoverstruts. A million years from now, when the rest of the city had crumbled, the bridge  would probably remain like a fossilized bone.  Unlike the other bridges into New Pretty Town, the old bridge couldnâ€ ™ t talkâ€”or report  trespassers, more importantly. But even silent, the bridge had always seemed very wise to  Tally, as quietly knowing as some ancient tree.
Her eyes were fully adjusted to the darkness now, and it took only seconds to find the  fishing line tied to its usual rock. She yanked it, and heard the splash of the rope tumbling  from where it had been hidden among the bridge supports. She kept pulling until the  invisible fishing line turned into wet, knotted cord.  The other end was still tied to the iron framework of the bridge. Tally pulled the rope taut  and lashed it to the usual tree.  She had to duck into the grass once more as another river skimmer passed. The people  dancing on its deck didnâ€ ™ t spot the rope stretched from bridge to shore. They never did.  New pretties were always having too much fun to notice little things out of place.  When the skimmerâ€ ™ s lights had faded, Tally tested the rope with her whole weight. One  time it had pulled loose from the tree, and both she and Peris had swung downward, then  up and out over the middle of the river before falling off, tumbling into the cold water. She  smiled at the memory, realizing she would rather be on that expeditionâ€”soaking wet in  the cold with Perisâ€”than dry and warm tonight, but alone.
Hanging upside down, hands and knees clutching the knots along the rope, Tally pulled  herself up into the dark framework of the bridge, then stole through its iron skeleton and  across to New Pretty Town.  She knew where Peris lived from the one message he had bothered to send since turning  pretty. Peris hadnâ€ ™ t given an address, but Tally knew the trick for decoding the randomlooking  numbers at the bottom of a ping. They led to someplace called Garbo Mansion in  the hilly part of town.  Getting there was going to be tricky. In their expeditions, Tally and Peris had always stuck  to the waterfront, where vegetation and the dark backdrop of Uglyville made it easy to  hide. But now Tally was headed into the center of the island, where floats and revelers  populated the bright streets all night.  Brand - new pretties like Peris always lived where the fun was most frantic.  Tally had memorized the map, but if she made one wrong turn, she was toast. Without her  interface ring, she was invisible to vehicles. Theyâ€ ™ d just run her down like she was nothing.  Of course, Tally was nothing here.
Worse, she was ugly. But she hoped Peris wouldnâ€ ™ t see it that way. Wouldnâ€ ™ t see her that  way.  Tally had no idea what would happen if she got caught. This wasnâ€ ™ t like being busted for  â€œforgettingâ€    her ring, skipping classes, or tricking the house into playing her music louder  than allowed. Everyone did that kind of stuff, and everyone got busted for it. But she and  Peris had always been very careful about not getting caught on these expeditions. Crossing  the river was serious business.  It was too late to worry now, though. What could they do to her, anyway? In three  months sheâ€ ™ d be a pretty herself.  Tally crept along the river until she reached a pleasure garden, and slipped into the  darkness beneath a row of weeping willows. Under their cover she made her way  alongside a path lit by little guttering flames.  A pretty couple wandered down the path. Tally froze, but they were clueless, too busy  staring into each otherâ€ ™ s eyes to see her rouching in the darkness. Tally silently watched  them pass, getting that warm feeling she always got from looking at a pretty face. Even
when she and Peris used to spy on them from the shadows, giggling at all the stupid things  the pretties said and did, they couldnâ€ ™ t resist taring. There was something magic in their  large and perfect eyes, something that made you want to pay attention to whatever they  said, to protect them from any danger, to make them happy. They were soâ€¦pretty.  The two disappeared around the next bend, and Tally shook her head to clear the mushy  thoughts away.  She wasnâ€ ™ t here to gawk. She was an infiltrator, a sneak, an ugly. And she had a mission.  The garden stretched up into town, winding like a black river through the bright party  towers and houses. After a few more minutes of creeping, she startled a couple hidden  among the trees (it was a pleasure garden, after all), but in the darkness they couldnâ€ ™ t see  her face, and only teased her as she mumbled an apology and slipped away. She hadnâ€ ™ t  seen too much of them, either, just a tangle of perfect legs and arms.  Finally, the garden ended, a few blocks from where Peris lived.  Tally peered out from behind a curtain of hanging vines. This was farther than she and
Peris had ever been together, and as far as her planning had taken her. There was no way  to hide herself in the busy, well - lit streets. She put her fingers up to her face, felt the wide  nose and thin lips, the too - high forehead and tangled mass of frizzy hair. One step out of  the underbrush and sheâ€ ™ d be spotted. Her face seemed to burn as the light touched it.  What was she doing here? She should be back in the darkness of Uglyville, awaiting her  turn.  But she had to see Peris, had to talk to him. She wasnâ€ ™ t quite sure why, exactly, except  that she was sick of imagining a thousand conversations with him every night before she  fell asleep. Theyâ€ ™ d spent every day together since they were littlies, and nowâ€¦nothing.

Three minutes might be enough to hold her for three months.  Tally looked up and down the street, checking for side yards to slink through, dark  doorways to hide in.  She felt like a rock climber facing a sheer cliff, searching for cracks and handholds.
The traffic began to clear a little, and she waited, rubbing the scar on her right palm.  Finally, Tally sighed and whispered, â€œBest friends forever,â€    and took a step forward into  the light.  An explosion of sound came from her right, and she leaped back into the darkness,  stumbling among the vines, coming down hard on her knees in the soft earth, certain for a  few seconds that sheâ€ ™ d been caught.  But the cacophony organized itself into a throbbing rhythm. It was a drum machine  making its lumbering way down the street. Wide as a house, it shimmered with the  movement of its dozens of mechanical arms, bashing away at every size of drum. Behind it  trailed a growing bunch of revelers, dancing along with the beat, drinking and throwing  their empty bottles to shatter against the huge, impervious machine.  Tally smiled. The revelers were wearing masks.  The machine was lobbing the masks out the back, trying to coax more followers into the  impromptu parade: devil faces and horrible clowns, green monsters and gray aliens with
big oval eyes, cats and dogs and cows, faces with crooked smiles or huge noses.  The procession passed slowly, and Tally pulled herself back into the vegetation. A few of  the revelers passed close enough that the sickly sweetness from their bottles filled her  nose. A minute later, when the machine had trundled half a block farther, Tally jumped out  and snatched up a discarded mask from the street. The plastic was soft in her hand, still  warm from having been stamped into shape inside the machine a few seconds before.  Before she pressed it against her face, Tally realized that it was the same color as the catvomit pink  of the sunset, with a long snout and two pink little ears. Smart adhesive flexed  against her skin as the mask settled onto her face.  Tally pushed her way through the drunken dancers, out the other side of the procession,  and ran down a side street toward Garbo Mansion, wearing the face of a pig.
