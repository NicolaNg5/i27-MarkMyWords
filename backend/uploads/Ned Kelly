Ned Kelly was a notorious Australian outlaw who became a folk hero in the 19th century. Born in 1850 near Melbourne, Victoria, Kelly's life was marked by hardship and conflict with the authorities.

Growing up in a poverty-stricken family, Kelly and his brothers often clashed with the police, who they believed were corrupt and biased against the working class. These tensions escalated into a series of crimes, including horse theft and bank robberies.

Kelly's most infamous act was the Kelly Gang's siege of the Glenrowan Inn in 1880. In a desperate stand against the police, the gang barricaded themselves inside the inn, leading to a fierce shootout that resulted in the deaths of several police officers and civilians.

Despite his crimes, Kelly's defiance of authority and his portrayal as a champion of the oppressed working class earned him a following among many Australians. His story has been the subject of numerous books, films, and songs.
